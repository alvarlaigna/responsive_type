# Responsive Type

The last time you will ever have to worry about responsive type, seriously! Configure all type settings in one file using sass variables.


## Usage

Add `responsive_type.scss` to your scss folder, and import into your `main.scss` file, I would also recommend resetting your css if you haven't already done so.

    import 'reset'; // recommended
    import 'responsive_type';
